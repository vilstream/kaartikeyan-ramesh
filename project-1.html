            <h1>DESIGN AND TESTING OF COATED/UNCOATED 3D PRINTED MILLING TOOL</h1>
            <h3>Coventry University</h3>
            <p>The project involves additive manufacturing of end mill tools (flat and ball types), evaluating their
                machining capability on aluminum blocks using SEM and EDX analyses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>3D printed end mills successfully machined aluminum, though with some breakage and chip formation issues.
                Flat end mills performed better than ball end mills, closely matching the performance of conventional
                carbide tools.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify tool design for improved strength and chip clearance.</li>
                <li>Increase spindle speed and feed rate.</li>
                <li>Ensure uniform material filling during manufacturing.</li>
